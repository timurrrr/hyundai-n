# Track days in an IONIQ 5 N

## For everyone

* Lug nuts:
  * The lug nuts are *not hex*. The shape is sometimes referred to as "21 mm flower", and you need a
    socket such as [LASER 6716](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7WMSX1).
  * The wheel studs and lug nuts use M14x?? threads.
  * The tightening torque is 176–196 N•m / 130–145 ft•lbs / 18-20 kg•m.
    * Interestingly, the 2025 US Owner's Manual lists two different torque spec ranges in different
      places. The lower one is in line with the torque specs typically suggested for M12 lug nuts
      like those used regular IONIQ 5, I suspect it was an oversight.
* The car comes with *one* tow hook from the factory, it's located in the Tire Mobility Kit under
  the trunk floor.
  * Many track day organirzations require two tow hooks. If you want to get a second tow hook,
    the IONIQ 5 tow hook (09147-AR000) seems to be identical to the one that comes with a 5 N.
* Pre-condition the battery for at least 10 minutes before driving on track for best performance.
* The parking brake automatically engages when you switch to the (P)arking mode, or if you open the
  driver's door.
  * However, you can then manually disengage the parking brake by pushing on the parking brake
    control on the door side of the steering wheel. The electric motors will provide some amount of
    resistance to rolling, so if you're on a sufficiently level surface the car should't move on its
    own. Use your judgement about how safe this is, consider using wheel chocks to be safe.
* While the Owner's Manual recommends 240 kPa / 35 psi hot pressure for track driving, with the
  factory alignment the front tires demonstrate high edge wear and even some amount of sidewall
  wear. You may find it useful running higher pressures. I personally ran 39 psi hot.
* Once again, the 2025 US Owner's Manual have conflicting information on the minimal tire pressure.
  It lists 29 psi (200 kPa) and 32 psi (220 kPa) literally on two adjacent pages. Go figure...

## For beginners

* The OEM brake pads and fluids should be sufficient for beginner pace in cool weather.
  * The car has functional brake cooling ducts on all for corners and additionally uses a lot of
    regen, reducing the amount of heat that goes into the braking system.
  * To reduce the amount of heat going into the brakes, try to minimize or completely avoid ABS
    engagement (like on any other car).
  * It's still recommended to do one or two cooldown laps at the end of the session to cool down the
    brakes with fresh air, using maximum regen to prevent more heat from going into the brakes.
