# Track days in an IONIQ 5 N

## For everyone

* Lug nuts:
  * The lug nuts are *not hex*. The shape is sometimes referred to as "21 mm flower", and you need a socket such as [LASER 6716](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7WMSX1).
  * The tightening torque is 176–196 N•m / 130–145 ft•lbs / 18-20 kg•m.
* The car comes with *one* tow hook from the factory, it's located in the Tire Mobility Kit under the trunk floor.
  * If you want to get a second tow hook, the IONIQ 5 tow hook (09147-AR000) fits.
* Pre-condition the battery for at least 10 minutes before driving on track for best performance.
* The parking brake automatically engages when you switch to the (P)arking mode, or if you open the driver's door.
  * However, you can then manually disengage the parking brake by pushing on the parking brake control on the door side of the steering wheel.

### Customized pedal behavior

* TODO: N-pedal.
* TODO: Special mode for left foot braking.

## For beginners

* The OEM brake pads and fluids should be sufficient for beginner pace in cool weather.
  * The car has functional brake cooling ducts and additionally uses a lot of regen, reducing the amount of heat that goes into the braking system.
  * It's still recommended to do one or two cooldown laps at the end of the session to cool down the brakes with fresh air, using maximum regen to prevent more heat from going into the brakes.
